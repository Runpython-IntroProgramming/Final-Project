## Functional Specification

This document should become the functional specification of the project you are working on.

A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. That is, it treats all hardware as a "black box", the contents of which are completely
unknown to the user. The functional specification should include sections with the following information:

Your specification **should include** the following types of information:

* Castlevania too, Electric Boogaloo
* Summary or introduction. In general, in a few lines or less, what is your program about or what is it about?
The program is a platformer videogame. You are a little knight lookin' fella who has to get to the end of the level.
* How does the user access your program? Is it shared via https://runpython.org? Is a web site? Embedded in 
  a single board computer? 
  It is shared via runpython
* If there are graphics screens involved, describe every screen that the user will experience: what is it for? 
  What did the user have to do to get there and how does she move on to the next?

Your specification should **not** include the following types of information:
