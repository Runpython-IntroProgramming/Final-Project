# Simon



## Functional Specification

My project is a common game known as Simon. In this game, there are four "buttons": red, yellow, green, and blue, each with their own sound when pressed. The computer begins by choosing a button, then waits for the user to repeat the same button. If the user is successful in repeating back, the computer extends the pattern, choosing the same button and then another button, and waiting for the user to repeat the pattern. This continues, getting harder as the pattern increases in length, until the user makes a mistake in their repetition. 

To use my program, the user would copy the URL into runpython.org. 

The user will see three types of screens: The first is a screen with buttons that light up and play their corresponding sound without input, as this is the portion of the game when the computer is creating the pattern. Next, they will see a graphic which says "Your Turn", indicating that the computer has finished with the pattern. Finally, the user sees the four buttons which will light up and play their corresponding sounds only with user input, which is accomplished by clicking the screen on the buttons.
