Currency Converter


## Functional Specification
The goal of this program is essentially to be able to convert from one currency to another based on current exchange rates. A user of the program can enter a currency and an amount and can convert that amount from that currency to any other currency. 

The user can access the program via runpython.com. 

The program involves no graphics or mouse input, but does involve keyboard input. The user of the program must enter in a currency and an amount to convert. Then the user must always enter in a currency that they would like to convert to. After the first input by the user, the name of a currency, the program goes to the dictionary containing the exchange rates for that currency. Then the user enters the amount they would like to convert, and the currency they would like to convert to. The program finds the exchange rate for that currency based on the first currency entered, and multiples the exchange rate by the currency. That is how the program responds to keyboard input. No graphical assets are used, this is simply a program using the vast computational power of python 3. The user does not need to do anything to install the program.
