Draw me a Picture!

This program allows the user to create an image using colors and icons.
______________________________________________________________________________
This program will be saved on github and accessed thru RunPython.
It uses images of a bird, a boy, a tree, a flower, a bunny, and a cat. It also creates a rectangle and many tiny circles (for drawing with different colors). It has 4 units of text: one stands by itself and the other three are placed together.

The user will pick one of several icons. The Icons will be: bunny, bird, flower, dog, tree, boy.
The user will click on an icon and then click on a point of the screen. A copy of the given icon will appear on that spot. After all the desired icons have been placed, the user will press return.

Then they will be able to draw with several different colors. This will be done by dragging the mouse across the screen while holding down exactly one alphabetic key (either g, q, o, b, p, r, or l), and the mouse itself.
When the user is done drawing, they will press return and a message will be displayed notifying them of the program's completion. It also explains that one can ctrl+click and the browser will allow you to save the image created.
The message is deleted when the users presses the return key for the third time (this is so they can save their creation without any words cluttering it up).

Instructions:
A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. 
Your specification **should include** the following types of information:

* Summary or introduction. In general, in a few lines or less, what is your program about or what is it about?
* How does the user access your program? Is it shared via http://runpython.com? Is a web site? Embedded in 
  a single board computer? 
* If there are graphics screens involved, describe every screen that the user will experience: what is it for? 
  What did the user have to do to get there and how does she move on to the next?
* For each graphics screen, describe every active control input and what it does. What elements on the screen will
  change in response to user input?
* Does the program respond to mouse input? What, exactly, does the mouse do?
* Does the program respond to keyboard input? How?
* What graphical assets will be used?

Your specification should **not** include the following types of information:
* How you will structure the classes, functions and code in your program.
* The name of any files or tools that you will use to design the program.
