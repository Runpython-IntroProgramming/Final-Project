# Simple Raycaster



## Functional Specification

This program will render a room in 3D using the technique of raycasting. This room will only have flat walls which are connected by right angles. The user will be able to walk around in this environment and collide with walls. The program will use ggame and will be shared via runpython.  The user will see a screen where they can edit the environment which the user moves in with the mouse. To access this screen the user will have to execute the script in runpython. Then, when the user presses the space key,the envrionment will be displayed in a first person perspective. The arrow keys will control the user's movements through the room. The left and right keys will make the user pivot and the up and down arrows will move the user forwards and backwards. There will be no way to sidestep. The program will use a series of thin rectangles to draw the walls.
