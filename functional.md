# Snake Game



## Functional Specification

This document should become the functional specification of the project you are working on.

A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. That is, it treats all hardware as a "black box", the contents of which are completely
unknown to the user. The functional specification should include sections with the following information:

Your specification **should include** the following types of information:

My program is a game which moves around a little snake, which when hits certain dots on the screen grows in length. The snake will die if it hits itself or if it hits the walls ot the game. 
My game can be found on github and run through runpython.com
The first screen that the user will see is a screen with a large black rectangle in the top left. This is the playing space. There will be two dots on the screen one is purple, it is the beginning of the snake. The other is blue. It is the snake food. To move the snake the player must press the arrow keys. It will move in the direction of the arrow key which is pressed. If the snake moves over one of the food things the snake will glow in length. If the space bar is pressed, the snake will stop moving until an arrow is pressed. If  the snake hits the edge or it hits itself the player will die. Pressing r will return it to its original state and start the game over. 
* Summary or introduction. In general, in a few lines or less, what is your program about or what is it about?
* How does the user access your program? Is it shared via http://runpython.com? Is a web site? Embedded in 
  a single board computer? 
* If there are graphics screens involved, describe every screen that the user will experience: what is it for? 
  What did the user have to do to get there and how does she move on to the next?
* For each graphics screen, describe every active control input and what it does. What elements on the screen will
  change in response to user input?
* Does the program respond to mouse input? What, exactly, does the mouse do?
* Does the program respond to keyboard input? How?
* What graphical assets will be used?
* Does the user have to do anything to install the program?

Your specification should **not** include the following types of information:

* The language you will use to create it.
* Names of any specific files in the project.
* How you will structure the classes, functions and code in your program.
* The name of any files or tools that you will use to design the program.
