Portal

I attempted to recreate a version of Portal by Valve. It's accessed by using http://runpython.com. There is one graphical screen, the one level I was able to create in my version of Portal. The mouse controls where the portals are placed, with the left click moving the orange portal while left click and alt control where the blue portal is. The keyboard controls how the player moves and interacts with objects. My game incorporates rectangles, squares, circles, assorted images for sprites, lines, and text. No installation in required, unless the browser running runpython doesn't use JavaScript, which would cause runpython to be unable to display any graphics as far as I'm aware.
