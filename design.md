Draw me a Picture!

## Design Specification
I will use runpython and the ggame library. This will utilize Python 3.

I have 6 icons which are displayed: a boy, bird, bunny, cat, tree, and flower. Each "icon" is a sprite. When the mouse is pressed down within 40 pixels of the center of that sprite, it will register that icon as being selected.The next place the user clicks on, a copy of the selected

The design specification should include information like:

* What tools or frameworks will you use to build the project (e.g. http://runpython.com or ggame)?
* What language will you use for coding (usually Python 3)?
* For every element of the Functional Specification, what code will need to be written to support it?
* What data will be stored or manipulated by the program? How will it be encoded and organized?
* Describe the logic and/or code behind every interaction with the user, and behind everything displayed.
* If your program uses an unusual or notable *algorithm*, what is the algorithm and how does it work?
