## Design Specification

I used runpython.org, ggame, and time to build this project using the language of Python 3. 
The design specificaiton is a counterpart to the Functional Speciffication. Where a functional specification concerns itself
with inputs and outputs from the program, or the *experience* of a user running the program, the design specification is concerned with decisions that the engineer and programmer must make during its creation.

As Simon is a game with a time delay, I built a step function with a time constraint. 

The design specification should include information like:

* For every element of the Functional Specification, what code will need to be written to support it?
* What data will be stored or manipulated by the program? How will it be encoded and organized?
* Describe the logic and/or code behind every interaction with the user, and behind everything displayed.
* If your program uses an unusual or notable *algorithm*, what is the algorithm and how does it work?
