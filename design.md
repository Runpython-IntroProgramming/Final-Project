## Design Specification

The design specificaiton is a counterpart to the Functional Speciffication. Where a functional specification concerns itself
with inputs and outputs from the program, or the *experience* of a user running the program, the design specification is concerned with decisions that the engineer and programmer must make during its creation.

The design specification should include information like:

* What tools or frameworks will you use to build the project (e.g. https://runpython.org or ggame)?
Runpython and ggame.
* What language will you use for coding (usually Python 3)?
Python
* For every element of the Functional Specification, what code will need to be written to support it?
THe code will use many of the class features of ggame.
* What data will be stored or manipulated by the program? How will it be encoded and organized?
The levelindex is the main piece of data that the program uses.
* Describe the logic and/or code behind every interaction with the user, and behind everything displayed.
The program detects a player input, and changes the velocity or the state of the player sprite.
* If your program uses an unusual or notable *algorithm*, what is the algorithm and how does it work?
It does not.
