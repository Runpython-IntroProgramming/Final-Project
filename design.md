## Design Specification

The design specification is a counterpart to the Functional Speciffication. Where a functional specification concerns itself
with inputs and outputs from the program, or the *experience* of a user running the program, the design specification is concerned with decisions that the engineer and programmer must make during its creation.

The design specification should include information like:

* What tools or frameworks will you use to build the project (e.g. http://runpython.com or ggame)?
Runpython and maybe enchant for a spell checker.
* What language will you use for coding (usually Python 3)?
Python 3
* For every element of the Functional Specification, what code will need to be written to support it?
I will make lists of the keywords and the input would be separated into sentences and cnverted to equations and expressions.
* What data will be stored or manipulated by the program? How will it be encoded and organized?
Yes, it will organize the input by taking out key words such as "sum" and converting it into "+" for the program to solve.
* Describe the logic and/or code behind every interaction with the user, and behind everything displayed.
The code takes out the numbers of integers of individual sentences. The key words are located such as "sum" and then converted to have an expression for which sentence. The question makes the entire thing into an equation which will solve the variable. The variable will be located by finding the capitals of proper nouns and the "'s" for possession. The word after the "'s" will be the variable.
* If your program uses an unusual or notable *algorithm*, what is the algorithm and how does it work?
Nothing unusual.
